	  has been enabled. This member is always set, unless there is no
	  standard library.

`std.version.minor`

### `std.gc`

`std.gc.get_threshold(generation)`

	* Gets the threshold of the collector for `generation`. Valid

	* Sets the threshold of the collector for `generation` to
	  `threshold`. Valid values for `generation` are `0`, `1` and
	  `2`. Valid values for `threshould` range from `0` to an
	  unspecified positive `integer`; overlarge values are capped
	  silently without failure. A larger `threshold` makes garbage
	  collection run less often but slower. Setting `threshold` to

	  function in C, except that null characters do not terminate
	  strings.

	* Returns a positive `integer` if `text1` compares greater than

### `std.array`

`std.array.slice(data, from, [length])`

	* Copies a subrange of `data` to create a new `array`. Elements
	  are copied from `from` if it is non-negative, and from
	  `lengthof(data) + from` otherwise. If `length` is set to an
	  `integer`, no more than this number of elements will be copied.
	  If it is absent, all elements from `from` to the end of `data`
	  will be copied. If `from` is outside `data`, an empty `array`
	  is returned.

	* Returns the specified subarray of `data`.

`std.array.replace_slice(data, from, replacement)`

	* Replaces all elements from `from` to the end of `data` with
	  `replacement` and returns the new `array`. If `from` is
	  negative, it specifies an offset from the end of `data`. This
	  function returns a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Returns a `array` with the subrange replaced.

`std.array.replace_slice(data, from, [length], replacement)`

	* Replaces a subrange of `data` with `replacement` to create a
	  new `array`. `from` specifies the start of the subrange to
	  replace. If `from` is negative, it specifies an offset from the
	  end of `data`. `length` specifies the maximum number of
	  elements to replace. If it is set to `null`, this function is
	  equivalent to `replace_slice(data, from, replacement)`. This
	  function returns a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Returns a `array` with the subrange replaced.

`std.array.max_of(data)`

	* Finds and returns the maximum element in `data`. Elements that
	  are unordered with the first element are ignored.

	* Returns a copy of the maximum element, or `null` if `data` is
	  empty.

`std.array.min_of(data)`

	* Finds and returns the minimum element in `data`. Elements that
	  are unordered with the first element are ignored.

	* Returns a copy of the minimum element, or `null` if `data` is
	  empty.

`std.array.find(data, target)`

	* Searches `data` for the first occurrence of `target`.

	* Returns the subscript of the first match of `target` in `data`
	  if one is found, which is always non-negative; otherwise
	  `null`.

	  search operation is performed on the same subrange that would
	  be returned by `slice(data, from)`.

	  if one is found, which is always non-negative; otherwise
	  `null`.

	  if one is found, which is always non-negative; otherwise
	  `null`.

`std.array.rfind(data, target)`

	* Searches `data` for the last occurrence of `target`.

	* Returns the subscript of the last match of `target` in `data`
	  if one is found, which is always non-negative; otherwise
	  `null`.

`std.array.rfind(data, from, target)`

	* Searches `data` for the last occurrence of `target`. The search
	  operation is performed on the same subrange that would be
	  returned by `slice(data, from)`.

	* Returns the subscript of such an element as an `integer`, if
	  one is found; otherwise `null`.

`std.array.is_sorted(data, [comparator])`

	* Checks whether `data` is sorted. That is, there is no pair of
	  adjacent elements in `data` such that the first one is greater
	  than or unordered with the second one. Elements are compared
	  using `comparator`, which shall be a binary `function` that
	  returns a negative `integer` if the first argument is less than
	  the second one, a positive `integer` if the first argument is
	  greater than the second one, or `0` if the arguments are equal;
	  other values indicate that the arguments are unordered. If no
	  `comparator` is provided, the builtin 3-way comparison operator
	  is used. An `array` that contains no elements is considered to
	  have been sorted.

	* Returns `true` if `data` is sorted or empty; otherwise `false`.

`std.array.binary_search(data, target, [comparator])`

	* Finds the first element in `data` that is equal to `target`.
	  The principle of user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the
	  `is_sorted()` function. As a consequence, the function call
	  `is_sorted(data, comparator)` shall yield `true` prior to this
	  call, otherwise the effect is undefined.

	* Returns the subscript of such an element as an `integer`, if
	  one is found; otherwise `null`.

	* Throws an exception if `data` has not been sorted properly. Be
	  advised that in this case there is no guarantee whether an
	  exception will be thrown or not.

`std.array.lower_bound(data, target, [comparator])`

	* Finds the first element in `data` that is greater than or equal
	  to `target` and precedes all elements that are less than
	  `target` if any. The principle of user-defined `comparator`s is
	  the same as the `is_sorted()` function. As a consequence, the
	  function call `is_sorted(data, comparator)` shall yield `true`
	  prior to this call, otherwise the effect is undefined.

	* Returns the subscript of such an element as an `integer`. This
	  function returns `lengthof(data)` if all elements are less than
	  `target`.

	* Throws an exception if `data` has not been sorted properly. Be
	  advised that in this case there is no guarantee whether an
	  exception will be thrown or not.

`std.array.upper_bound(data, target, [comparator])`

	* Finds the first element in `data` that is greater than `target`
	  and precedes all elements that are less than or equal to
	  `target` if any. The principle of user-defined `comparator`s is
	  the same as the `is_sorted()` function. As a consequence, the
	  function call `is_sorted(data, comparator)` shall yield `true`
	  prior to this call, otherwise the effect is undefined.

	* Returns the subscript of such an element as an `integer`. This
	  function returns `lengthof(data)` if all elements are less than
	  or equal to `target`.

	* Throws an exception if `data` has not been sorted properly. Be
	  advised that in this case there is no guarantee whether an
	  exception will be thrown or not.

`std.array.equal_range(data, target, [comparator])`

	* Gets the range of elements equivalent to `target` in `data` as
	  a single function call. This function is equivalent to calling
	  `lower_bound(data, target, comparator)` and
	  `upper_bound(data, target, comparator)` respectively then
	  storing both results in an `array`.

	* Returns an `array` of two `integer`s, the first of which
	  specifies the lower bound and the other specifies the upper
	  bound.

	* Throws an exception if `data` has not been sorted properly. Be
	  advised that in this case there is no guarantee whether an
	  exception will be thrown or not.

`std.array.sort(data, [comparator])`

	* Sorts elements in `data` in ascending order. The principle of
	  user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the `is_sorted()`
	  function. The algorithm shall finish in `O(n log n)` time where
	  `n` is the number of elements in `data`, and shall be stable.
	  This function returns a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Returns the sorted `array`.

	* Throws an exception if any elements are unordered. Be advised
	  that in this case there is no guarantee whether an exception
	  will be thrown or not.

`std.array.generate(generator, length)`

	* Calls `generator` repeatedly up to `length` times and returns
	  an `array` consisting of all values returned. `generator` shall
	  be a binary function. The first argument will be the number of
	  elements having been generated; the second argument is the
	  previous element generated, or `null` in the case of the first
	  element.

	* Returns an `array` containing all values generated.

`std.array.shuffle(data, [seed])`

	* Shuffles elements in `data` randomly. If `seed` is set to an
	  `integer`, the internal pseudo random number generator will be
	  initialized with it and will produce the same series of numbers
	  for a specific `seed` value. If it is absent, a random seed is
	  obtained each time this function is called. This function
	  returns a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Returns the shuffled `array`.
