`std.debug.print([args...])`

	* Prints all `args` to the standard error stream, separated by
	  spaces. A line break is appended to terminate the line.

	* Returns `true` if the operation succeeds.

`std.debug.dump(value, [indent_increment])`

	* Prints the value to the standard error stream with detailed
	  information. `indent_increment` specifies the number of spaces
	  used as a single level of indent. Its value is clamped between
	  `0` and `10` inclusively. If it is set to `0`, no line break is
	  inserted and output lines are not indented. It has a default
	  value of `2`.

	* Returns `true` if the operation succeeds.
